I build this simple expense tracker "app", it has no  GUI yet, to test my skill in  c++. You can rtack your expenses of different types.
You just have to specify what kind of expense you want to introduce.
I will make some statistics, when someone wants to see their total, it will show you the perceentage of each type of expense you have.
I used basic concepts and  a little bit of OOP.
